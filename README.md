# Data-Science:
This repository offers a comprehensive collection of diverse data science projects, encompassing a wide range of disciplines such as data analysis, machine learning models, data visualizations, data cleaning scripts, data processing pipelines, and much more. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced data scientist, you will find a project that suits your level of expertise.

## 1 Exploratory Data Analysis:
This project is an exploratory data analysis of the National Rural Access Program (NRAP) datasource, which contains data trasnport sector. The notebook provides a detailed analysis of the dataset, including data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis. The analysis aims to provide insights into the relationships between different variables and identify trends in the data. The notebook is organized in a clear and concise manner, making it easy for readers to follow along and understand the insights. The findings and recommendations based on the analysis are summarized at the end of the notebook.

## 2 Price Prediction Project:
This project showcases a sophisticated machine learning model that predicts housing prices with remarkable accuracy. By leveraging the California housing DataSource, our model is able to provide valuable insights into the real estate market, helping buyers and sellers make informed decisions. With meticulous attention to detail, our project encompasses a thorough data analysis process, including data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
